Hello there,
This is a project me and my friend developed for our Digital Image Processing course over the 2021 semester in AYBU.
To run the GUI, you must have the Image Processing Toolbox installed for MATLAB.
For GUI to run you need to keep the watermarker.m and watermarked.fig together in a folder of your choice.

First, choose a jpeg background image. Second, choose a transparent png logo. 
Then you can enter a width value. After clicking the "Choose Location" button and clicking somewhere random in the image, 
you are halfway there to apply watermark or embossment. After entering an Alpha Level between 0 and 1.
(0:No transparency, 1:Full transparency) 
you can click "Watermark" button. To apply a embossment, first click the "Create Embossment" button. 
Then choose a Brightness Level between 0 and 1. 
(0:Lowest Brightness 1:Full Brightness). 
Click "Apply Embossment" button. 
To exit the GUI, click the EXIT button below.');
